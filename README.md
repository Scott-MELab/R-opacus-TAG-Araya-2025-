This repository contains an Excel file containing the model's reactions, the GPR rule constructed from the genome obtained from NCBI (RefSeq assembly GCF_001646735.1), the direction of each reaction, and the enzyme commission (EC) number. 
Additionally, a neutral core model code is uploaded (which does not maximize any objective function and has no substrate consumption), along with the map and the model in JSON format for loading into Escher.
