This folder contains the maps obtained in Escher (.svg) after simulating TAG accumulation for each substrate evaluated in this study, using their corresponding experimentally determined uptake rates. Below is a brief description of how the different fluxes (mmol/gCDW·h) for each TAG-associated reaction were calculated.

- Glucose EMP: The lower bound for glucose uptake was set to -1.94 mmol/gCDW·h and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-Glucose reaction was maximized.
- Glucose ED: Same as the previous case, but the reactions glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 6-phosphofructokinase, and fructose bisphosphate aldolase had both their lower and upper bounds set to zero.
- Acetate: The lower bound for acetate uptake was set to -4.69 mmol/gCDW·h and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-acetate reaction was maximized.
- 1-Propanol: The lower bound for 1-proanol uptake was set to -1.88 mmol/gCDW·h, and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-1-Propanol reaction was maximized.
- Butyric Acid: The lower bound for butyric acid (Butanoate + proton) uptake was set to -1.79 mmol/gCDW·h, and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-ButiricAcid reaction was maximized.
- Valeric Acid: The lower bound for valeric acid (Valerate + proton) uptake was set to -1.12 mmol/gCDW·h, and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-ValericAcid reaction was maximized.
- Knallgas: The lower bound for hydrogen uptake was set to -21.93 mmol/gCDW·h and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-Knallgas reaction was maximized.
- Methanol RuMP: The lower bound for methanol uptake was set to -5.36 mmol/gCDW·h and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-Methanol reaction was maximized. The reactions associated with formaldehyde assimilation through the Serine pathway and dissimilation were deactivated.
- Methanol Serine Pathway (SP): The lower bound for methanol uptake was set to -5.36 mmol/gCDW·h and the upper bound to 0, while the TAG-Methanol reaction was maximized. The reaction associated with RuMP was deactivated.
